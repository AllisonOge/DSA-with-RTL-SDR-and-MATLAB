##Energy detection Algorithm for Dynamic Spectrum Sensing
This section implement an energy detection algorithm and tests performance based on receiver characteristics curve (ROC) - plot of probability of detection against probability of false alarm.
The code is an implementation of derived formulars.

Open *Energy_detecction_simulation.m* file to run the simulation

plots of the ROC plots, time and frequency plots are also included for different SNR.
The algorithm is inefficient for low SNR

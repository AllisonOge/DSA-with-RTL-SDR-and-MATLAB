## Implementation of Dynamic spectrum access in the FM spectrum. 
The code implements 3 parts: spectrum sensing using energy detection, channel selection with an algorithm that considers the best channel to improve SU efficiency and lastly FM demodulation at the physical layer with RTLSDR.
Open the file *FM_receiver_with_DSA.m* to observe the implementation as the channels are been sensed and received into an audio file called *audio_file_DSA.wav*.

*FM_receiver.m* file shows the implementation of FM demodulation only
